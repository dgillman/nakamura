* KERN-2200 Upgrade mysql-connector-java to latest version 5.1.17 554d863

* KERN-2185 Added group filter to tag cloud with unit test. 65bf185
* KERN-2122 - added logic to allow a user to remove a content item, that they do not own and don't have write access to, from My library.  They would do this by removing themselves from a content item's viewer list via a :viewer@Delete= POST to the content item's URL appended w members.json.  A typical curl statement would be curl -e /dev/testing -u bp7742:testuser -F:viewer@Delete=bp7742 -F_charset_=utf-8 http://localhost:8080/p/iOkuc2Kv38.members.json.  As the user does not own the content item, they can only remove themself from the viewer list. 1beae14
